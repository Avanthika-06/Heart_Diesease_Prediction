# Heart_Diesease_Prediction

This project presents a comprehensive heart disease prediction system built using Python and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a public dataset containing various health metrics and patient information to identify and classify the likelihood and severity of heart disease.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of key variables such as age, gender, chest pain types, blood pressure, and more.

Visualizations: Detailed visual representations to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Data Cleaning & Imputation: Missing values handled using iterative imputation and ML-based approaches.

Outlier Detection & Handling: Smart removal and correction of anomalous values for better model performance.

Multi-Class Classification: Predicts four stages of heart disease (0 = No disease, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe).

ML Model Integration: Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to identify the best performing algorithm.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (ML models, imputation, preprocessing)

Iterative Imputer

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and more. The target variable categorizes the presence and severity of heart disease.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Work
Integrate advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest)

Build a front-end interface using Flask/Streamlit

Deploy model as a web application
